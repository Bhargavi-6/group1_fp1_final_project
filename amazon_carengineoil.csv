"Shell Helix HX8 5W-30 API SN Plus Fully Synthetic Engine Oil for Petrol, Diesel & CNG Cars (3.5 L), medium",https://www.amazon.in/Shell-Helix-5W-30-Synthetic-Engine/dp/B07SBF8QGB,22 April 2022,initial impressions ,4,my chevrolet spark is giving me low mileage and the temperature bar goes up to four which is not abnormal but i remember seeing it mostly on 3 bars hence even though i ve not really used the car more than 1300km after last oil change i decided to change the oil plus the suspicion of the local mechanic putting cheap oil for something else was strong since the engine runs with some harshness that i ve felt since i use fully synthetic oil for my cbr 250r i do had a good knowledge about engine oils and what should i get if i m looking after the best of oils i began the research and finally decided on shell helix h8 5w 30 fully synthetic oil i was happy when product arrived and i ve decided to do the oil change myself this time no more local mechanic for something simple as this but i was put on test when i was trying to loosen the drain bolt and the oil filter the local mechanic have over tightened it by to the moon and back but i didn t give up and finally used some wd 40 on the bolt and used all my strength i can have with my hand laying under the spark with very minimal distance for any movement and tada finally i ve won over the local mechanic the bolt is loosened and the black fluid started to drip and surprisingly there was few bits of rust too second thing was removing the engine oil filter an over tightened oil filter deservers a stab in it s heart with a screw driver then you twist it so you get more power for to twist and it worked thanks to people who put diy videos like this finally it s time to put the expensive engine oil i brought for around 1900 with excitement i filled the engine belly with 2 5 liters of oil that much oil was enough for my chevrolet spark which recommended about 3 2 liters of engine said the oil without any hesitance i think some of old oil might still be inside of maybe i ve to run the car for a while and ask the dipstick again and this time i got around 8 10 over the min to full scale on dipstick which means i have to put around 700 milli leters of oil in again which i ve not put yet now the ride the engine was noticibly calmer but i think it s not for everyone to detect i ve a keen mind to observe and feel the vibrations of the people of things i m surrounded with and i think if you re one of those people you ll like the vibrations you feel now the gear shift was also say a 1 4 times better the driving smoothness is atleast 1 6 times better the temperature have gone down to 3 bars and it takes a good time for it to reach 3 bars it s hard to give out a all out professional review but here s a layman s review on this oil i m satisfied with this product but it s my first time trying out all this with a car hence i don t have much to compare other than the old oil which is likely a cheap mineral oil plus i ve seen a lot of people recommend to use mineral oil and do oil changes more frequently than using expensive synthetic oil and doing the oil change a lot later do i guess finally it s your choice atleast this won t be your last oil change ps will update the review and add more details about mileage long distance driving etcgood day
